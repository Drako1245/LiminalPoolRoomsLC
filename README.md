An interior mod for Lethal Company

Not published to thunderstore yet, currently in playtest phase.

If you are are curious about how I did anything, feel free to message me on discord: drako1245  
I'm usually happy to help, but I am very inexperienced so I may not have the answer for everything  

This mod adds a liminal pools themed dungeon to lethal company.
Includes:
- Functional water inside
- Apparatus and light function
- tbd

# Manual Installation
First make sure you have BepInEx installed to your lethal company instance on steam, there
are plenty of tutorials on youtube to figure out how to do that if you don't know how. Once
you have that set up, install Evaisa's LethalLib mod, IAmBatby's LethalLevelLoader mod, and
Evaisa's HookGenPatcher (This goes in patchers instead of plugins). Finally download 
LiminalPools.zip and extract it into your plugins folder. Once it has been run once a config
file will generate and you can tailor your experience to your liking or just leave it default.

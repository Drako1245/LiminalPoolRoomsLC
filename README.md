# Configuration
Configuration can now be done through Lethal Level Loader!  
To configure Liminal Pools, navigate to LethalLevelLoader.cfg in configs  
Enable content configuration and modify values to be what you want  

# Manual Installation
First make sure you have BepInEx installed to your lethal company instance on steam, there
are plenty of tutorials on youtube to figure out how to do that if you don't know how. Once
you have that set up, install Evaisa's LethalLib mod, IAmBatby's LethalLevelLoader mod, and
Evaisa's HookGenPatcher (This goes in patchers instead of plugins). Finally download 
LiminalPools.zip and extract it into your plugins folder. Once it has been run once a config
file will generate and you can tailor your experience to your liking or just leave it default.
